## CVE-2022-42889

In October 2022, a critical vulnerability in the commons-text library became known ([CVE-2022-42889](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/GHSL-2022-018_Apache_Commons_Text/)). jsass uses the commons-text library, but not the affected StringSubstitutor class!
Thus, jsass is not directly affected by this vulnerability.
However, in Jsass version 5.10.5, the commons-text dependency has been updated to version 1.10.0.

## Developers

### Gradle tasks you should know

`gradle check` runs checkstyle, pmd, junit locally.

`gradle runDockerTests` runs junit tests on all docker containers.

`gradle buildNativeLibs` build the native libs, using our build docker container.

### How to make a release

```bash
$ ./gradlew clean release
$ git checkout $(git describe --abbrev=0)
$ ./gradlew clean uploadArchives
```

Don't forget to release the artifact from [staging repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/#stagingRepositories)!
